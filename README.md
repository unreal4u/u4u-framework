u4u-framework
-------------

This framework was conceived originally as a simple and quick system to make some enterprise pages. In time, it scaled
up very quickly and many many modules later it grew up to be almost a CMS by itself.

As a very enthusiastic developer I didn't want this little system I built go lost, so I stripped out almost everything
it had related to the company I used to work for and built it again, this time doing things right and adopting standards
which I didn't have when I originally wrote this framework.

Finally, what began as a job ended up being a hobby: this framework is NOT a stable one, neither it is being currently
used in some enterprise: it is just used as a playground for me where I can grew up with some of the discoveries I've
made in time in PHP. If you want to use it, do it at your own risk! Any improvements are naturally welcome.

How to install
-------------

Sadly, there is no easy way to install this framework (yet). I might (or not) some day add an installer that works fine
with different databases and different setups, but in the meantime you can follow the main guidelines:

* First, check it out and install:
 <code>git clone git@github.com:unreal4u/u4u-framework.git
 cd u4u-framework<code>
* Next, make the database:
 <code>mysql -u<user> -p</code>
